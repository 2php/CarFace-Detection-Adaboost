# CarFace-Detection-Adaboost
Using adaboost to detect carface
This is a C++ project using opencv interfacces to detect carface from image. Those image is caputred by surveillance cameras. 
So the carface detection looks like not so difficult. 
The cascade file is generated by the opencv_traincascade.exe which is in the opencv lib you can get from opencv official website.
In this Repository, I haved trained two cascade files (not so perfect just for test) you can find.
That's all.
